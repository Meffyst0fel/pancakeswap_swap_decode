# pancakeswap_swap_decode
The code is used to pull swap transactions from panckeswap with further decoding of data. 
The code is raw, but may be useful to someone. The code does not process closed filters, which will eventually cause an error. 
I would also add here MCAP analysis, liquidity via subgraphs (https://ide.bitquery.io/ for example or something else) or third-party APIs.
In the same way we make the exchange rate to USDT.
